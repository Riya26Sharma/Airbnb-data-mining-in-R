Introduction

Airbnb.com is a popular home-sharing platform where homeowners can rent out full houses, apartments, bedrooms, or even beds to travelers. Hosts on Airbnb make money by renting out their properties, while renters provide feedback by posting public ratings and comments regarding their stay.

The goal of this data mining project is to develop a predictive model to forecast the likelihood of a listing on Airbnb.com having a high booking rate. By analyzing various attributes of the property listings, such as location, amenities, pricing, and host details, the model aims to provide numerical predictions for the probability that a listing will have a high booking rate. This predictive model can be a valuable tool for property listers to assess which attributes are most sought-after by customers, enabling them to optimize their listings and potentially increase revenue from their properties.

Project Overview

This project is implemented using R programming language. The key steps involved in the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the raw Airbnb data for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between different attributes and the booking rate. This involves visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlation analysis.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
Model Development: Building machine learning models to predict the probability of high booking rates for Airbnb listings. This may involve techniques such as logistic regression, random forest, or gradient boosting.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC.
Deployment and Usage: Deploying the final model for real-world usage, where property listers can input the attributes of their listings to obtain predictions of their booking rates.
